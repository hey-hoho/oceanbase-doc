# Set and view audit rules

After you enable security audit, you must set audit rules to enable auditing on user operations. 

## Limitations

OceanBase Database supports security audit only in Oracle mode. 

## Set audit rules

Log on to an Oracle tenant as the `ORAAUDITOR` user and set the following types of audit rules:

* Statement audit: the audit of specific operations. You do not specify the objects, but you can specify whether the audit rules apply to specific or all users. 
* Object audit: the audit of the operations that are performed on specified objects. You can specify whether the audit rules apply to specific or all users. 

An audit rule is also a schema object. You can execute the AUDIT and NOAUDIT statements to set audit rules. 

For more information about the audit rules, see [AUDIT](../../../700.reference/400.development-reference/100.sql-syntax/300.common-tenant-of-oracle-mode/900.sql-statement-of-oracle-mode/300.dcl-of-oracle-mode/200.audit-of-oracle-mode.md). 

For example, audit the INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations on table `tbl1` of `user1`.

```shell
obclient> AUDIT INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE ON user1.tbl1;
```

## View audit rules

After you set the audit rules, you can view them by using a series of data dictionary views that are compatible with Oracle. 

| Dictionary views | Features |
|-----------|--------|
| [ALL_DEF_AUDIT_OPTS](../../../700.reference/500.system-reference/500.system-overview-of-oracle-mode/200.dictionary-view-of-oracle-mode/900.all_def_audit_opts-of-oracle-mode.md) | Records default audit rules of new objects. Valid values of each column:<br> * `-/-`: By default, no auditing is performed.<br> * `A/-`: Auditing is performed when the execution of the statement is successful.<br> `-/A`: Auditing is performed when the execution of the statement fails. * `A/A`: Auditing is performed regardless of whether the execution of the statement is successful. |
| [DBA_STMT_AUDIT_OPTS](../../../700.reference/500.system-reference/500.system-overview-of-oracle-mode/200.dictionary-view-of-oracle-mode/10000.dba_stmt_audit_opts-of-oracle-mode.md) | Records detailed auditing configuration at the statement level.  |
| [DBA_OBJ_AUDIT_OPTS](../../../700.reference/500.system-reference/500.system-overview-of-oracle-mode/200.dictionary-view-of-oracle-mode/8500.dba_obj_audit_opts-of-oracle-mode.md) | Records detailed auditing configuration at the object level.  |


View the audit rules in the `ALL_DEF_AUDIT_OPTS` view. Example:

```shell
obclient> SELECT * FROM SYS.ALL_DEF_AUDIT_OPTS;
```
