# Audit specified database objects

OceanBase Database allows you to specify database objects that you want to audit. You can record only the specified types of operations performed on these objects. The database objects that can be audited are tables, sequences, and views.

## Limitations

OceanBase Database supports security audit only in Oracle mode.

## Audit operations of a user on a specified database object

Example: To audit insert operations of the `aud` user on the `tab1` table,

log on to the database as the `ORAAUDITOR` user and enable security audit.

```shell
obclient> AUDIT INSERT ON tab1 BY aud;
```

## Audit specified operations of all users on a specified database object

Example: To audit failed DML operations of all users on the `tab1` table,

log on to the database as the `ORAAUDITOR` user and enable security audit.

```shell
obclient> AUDIT INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON tab1 WHENEVER NOT SUCCESSFUL;
```
