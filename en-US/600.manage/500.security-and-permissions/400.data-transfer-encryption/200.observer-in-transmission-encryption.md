# OBServer transmission encryption

The underlying communication between components such as OBServer node, liboblog, and ob_admin depends on the `libeasy` library. Therefore, the supported methods for loading private keys/certificates are the same (local file mode). This means that the CA certificate, user certificate, and private key should be placed in the `wallet` directory, and they will be read and loaded from this directory when the corresponding configuration item is enabled.

## Enable OBServer transmission encryption

The method for enabling OBServer transmission encryption involves the use of multiple configuration items. To enable it, perform the following steps:

1. Log on to the `sys` tenant as the root user.

2. Specify the method for loading the CA certificate, user certificate, and private key.

   ```sql
   alter system set ssl_external_kms_info = '
   {
   "ssl_mode":"file"
   }';
   ```

3. Enable SSL communication on the MySQL port.

   By default, SSL communication is disabled on the MySQL port. It can be enabled by configuring the `ssl_client_authentication` parameter and the configuration will take effect immediately.

   ```sql
   alter system set ssl_client_authentication = 'TRUE';
   When the parameter is set to `TRUE`, SSL communication in MySQL is immediately enabled.
   ```

4. Configure an SSL allowlist for RPC communication. Since the TCP connections between OBServer nodes are persistent, SSL-encrypted RPC communication can be enabled only after the OBServer nodes are restarted.

   ```sql
   An allowlist is required to enable SSL-encrypted RPC communication.
   alter system set _ob_ssl_invited_nodes='ALL'; Enable SSL for the entire cluster.
   alter system set _ob_ssl_invited_nodes='135.xxx.xx.xx, 128.xxx.xx.xx'; Enable SSL only for OBServer nodes with the specified IP addresses.
   ssl
   ```

## Check whether OBServer transmission encryption is enabled

The most straightforward approach is to capture packets from the MySQL and RPC ports of the OBServer node to check whether the packets are encrypted. You can also use the following method:

* Use the system tenant account to log on to an OBServer node from OBClient or a MySQL client, and query the `ssl_cert_expired_time` field in the `oceanbase.GV$OB_SERVERS` view, to check whether SSL is enabled.

* This field records the expiration time of the SSL certificate used by the current OBServer node when SSL is enabled. The time is displayed in UTC with a unit of microseconds.

   ```shell
   obclient> select svr_ip, svr_port,zone, ssl_cert_expired_time, from_unixtime(ssl_cert_expired_time/1000000) from oceanbase.GV$OB_SERVERS;
   +--------------+----------+-------+----------------------+---------------------------------------------+
   | svr_ip       | svr_port | zone  | ssl_cert_expired_time | from_unixtime(ssl_key_expired_time/1000000) |
   +--------------+----------+-------+----------------------+---------------------------------------------+
   | 100.xx.xx.xx |    13212 | zone1 |           1871860075 | 2029-04-26 09:07:55                         |
   +--------------+----------+-------+----------------------+---------------------------------------------+
   1 row in set (0.00 sec)
   ```

### Check whether SSL is enabled on the MySQL port

Log on to an OBServer node from OBClient or a MySQL client and run the `\s` command to query the SSL field.

```shell
obclient> \s

### Check whether SSL is enabled on the RPC port

In the `OBServer.log` file, search for the keyword "rpc connection accept" and check the value of `use_ssl`. If the value is `True`, SSL is enabled for RPC communication. Otherwise, SSL is disabled.

  <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note:</h4>
    <p>You must restart the cluster or disconnect the existing RPC connection for SSL to take effect. </p>
  </main>
